                    Psychotherapy offers a confidential, judgment-free space, in which you and your
                    therapist will be able to think together about the issues that are troubling you. You
                    will be encouraged to explore freely your experiences, thoughts and emotions, in
                    order to arrive at a renewed sense of understanding, self-appreciation and self-
                    compassion.
                </p>
