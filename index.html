                    <em>"I am here to listen."</em>
                    I am an experienced Psychodynamic Psychotherapist working online at the moment.
                    Decision to come to therapy is not easy. But you going through this pages is telling me that you
                    might be close to a big step towards you finding that moment in which to decide to go for it.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Whether it is the pressure of everyday life, unresolved issues from the past, being overwhelmed by
                    challenging emotions, atypical behaviour, or solely wanting to understand yourself better, I am
                    here. You don't have to do this on your own. Together, we can explore your concerns in a
                    confidential and non-judgemental space.
                </p>
                <h2>Modality</h2>
                <p>"Psychodynamic modality includes connecting the past and the present, looking at the earliest
                    childhood experiences so that we can get a better understanding of the here and now.
