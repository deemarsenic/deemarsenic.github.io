                <p>
                    I am an experienced psychodynamic psychotherapist with a background in culture, arts and economics.
                    I have worked with a wide range of issues such as anxiety, depression, trauma, ADHD, eating
                    disorders, emotional and sexual abuse and suicidal feelings. I also have experience with social and
                    cultural differences, problems with a sense of identity and belonging, inter-generational trauma and
                    FGM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold a postgraduate degree in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy from WPF Therapy, Roehampton University,
                    a Foundation Course in Psychoanalysis at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in London,
                    Certificates in Trauma Therapy and Safeguarding and worked as an associate Psychotherapist with
                    young people and students at Roehampton University.
                </p>
                <p>I offer both long-term, open-ended work and short-term therapy, which usually lasts
                    12 weeks. Sessions can be online, or in person a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5WcvEFhnC7zq5GSb8">

                <h1 id="main-title">Fees</h1>
                <p>At my practice, I offer both open-ended and 12 week time-limited therapy. The fee for open-ended
                    therapy is £70 per session, which allows for a more flexible and ongoing therapeutic process.</p>
                <p>For those seeking a more structured and focused approach, I offer a time-limited therapy at a fee of
                    £85 per
                    session.</p>
                <p>Both options will require an initial 90-minute session at a cost of £85, during which we will
                    discuss your therapeutic goals and needs in greater detail. Please feel free to contact me to
                    discuss
                    which option may be the best fit for you, and to schedule your initial session.</p>
